JavaScript Movie Collection App

This is a simple JS Web app that applies the concepts shown on the course [JavaScript - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) by  Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

This covers the Working with the DOM section.

Thanks a lot to Maximilian Schwarzmüller for such an excellent course.
